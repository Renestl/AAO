# Permutations
# Write a recursive method permutations(array) that calculates all the permutations of the given array. For an array of length n there are n! different permutations. So for an array with three elements we will have 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 different permutations.

# permutations([1, 2, 3]) # => [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2],
#                         #     [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1],
#                         #     [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
# You can use Ruby's built in Array#permutation method to get a better understanding of what you will be building.

# [1, 2, 3].permutation.to_a  # => [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2],
#                             #     [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1],
#                             #     [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]

def permutations(array)
	return [array] if array.length <= 1

	first = array.shift
	perms = permutations(array)
	total_permutations = []

	perms.each do |perm|
		(0..perm.length).each do |i|
			total_permutations << perm[0...i] + [first] + perm[i..-1]

	total_permutations
