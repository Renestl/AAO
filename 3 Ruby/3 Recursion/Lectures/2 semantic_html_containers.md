# Thinking in boxes

As we continue structuring web pages we should try to maintain a perspective of seeing all of these HTML element building blocks as boxes.

By thinking in boxes and boxes surrounding other boxes we will be able to create more advanced layouts and have an easier time styling our layouts in the future with Cascading Style Sheets.

## Containers

The HTML Elements that are purely used to hold other HTML elements are commonly called containers.

## Semantic HTML

some of the tags used to define container elements:

```
<header>
    Container for elements in the top header section of a page
</header>
```

```
<footer>
    Container for elements in the bottom footer section of a page
</footer>
```

```
<nav>
    Usually used to hold navigation elements like lists of links
</nav>
```

```
<article>
    Used to hold content that makes sense on its own like Posts or Comments
</article>
```

```
<aside>
    Used to hold sidebar sections that are tangentially related to the content
</aside>
```

```
<figure>
    Holds images, graphic content, code samples etc.
</figure>
```

```
<figcaption>
    Holds caption content for a corresponding figure element
</figcaption>
```

```
<section>
    A section of the page or chapter of an <article> with a heading
</section>
```

```
<div>
    A common container element used when other semantic elements do not seem appropriate
</div>
```

Other than the div element, all of these tags were introduced in HTML5. 

When looking for the right HTML Element we can always refer back to the great [MDN HTML Elements Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).
