# Array Subsets
# Write a method subsets that will return all subsets of an array.

# subsets([]) # => [[]]
# subsets([1]) # => [[], [1]]
# subsets([1, 2]) # => [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]
# subsets([1, 2, 3])
# # => [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
# You can implement this as an Array method if you prefer.

# Hint: For subsets([1, 2, 3]), there are two kinds of subsets:

# Those that do not contain 3 (all of these are subsets of [1, 2]).
# For every subset that does not contain 3, there is also a corresponding subset that is the same, except it also does contain 3.

def subsets(array)
	return [[]] if array.empty?

	subset = subsets(array.take(array.length - 1))
	set = subset.map { |sub| sub + [array.last]}

	subset + set
end
