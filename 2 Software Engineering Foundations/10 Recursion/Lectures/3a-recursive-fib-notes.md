# When is recursion appropriate?

Recursion allows us to solve problems in an elegant way. However, recursion is a tool that is only appropriate for certain problems. Look to the struture of a problem to figure out if it can be solved recursively. **Recursion is used to solve problems that can be decomposed into smaller versions of the *same* problem.**
